          If there are any charities whose work focus on something you care
          about, making a small donation to those charities will show them a lot
          of trust & support and therefore motivate them to keep going. It
          doesn't have to be much, a one-off donation of as little as Â£1 is just
          as amazing!
          <br />
          Below are some top charities that focus on tackling plastic waste and
          pollution and protect the ocean:
          {this.state.webPagesList.map(item => {
            return (
              <ul key={item.id}>
                <li>
                  <a href={item.linkTo}>{item.title}</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            );
          })}
          <br />
          Finally, you can also shop at{" "}
          <a href="http://smile.amazon.co.uk">smile.amazon.co.uk</a>, where
          Amazon will donate a small proportion of your purchases towards a
          charity of your choice.
