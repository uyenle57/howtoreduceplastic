        <b>How To Reduce Plastic</b> was created by <a href="https://uyen-le.me">Uyen Le</a> with the hope to help fight todays <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/06/plastic-planet-waste-pollution-trash-crisis/">global plastic pollution problems</a>.
        The site contains actions, tips and resouces that she found have helped to reduce her personal plastic consumption dramatically.
        <br/><br/>
        Through lively and colourful illustrations, she hopes to spread the message that reducing plastic can be super fun and easy, and
        therefore inspire others to <b>join the fight against plastic and together save the environment!</b> <span role="img" aria-label="Green Leaf">🌿</span><span role="img" aria-label="Whale">🐋</span>
